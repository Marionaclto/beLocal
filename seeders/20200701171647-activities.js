I will show you where I buy all the fresh ingredients for the Paella, and we will walk through the fabulous market, my favorite place in Barcelona, so that you can see in detail how one of the most iconic markets in Europe lives. From there we will go to my house, where we will have appetizers, I´ll teach you how to prepare the Spanish 'bread with tomato', we will make sangria together, and the delicious Catalan cream for dessert, while we wait for the Paella :). All this in a beautiful living room with balconies to the Ramblas, with soft drinks, beer and good wines, it´ll be a day that you will enjoy a lot!",

Wheat and barley fields, organic wineyards, old almond and olive trees, hills and slopes furrowed by ancient dry stone walls and incredible views will melt before your sight. Don’t worry if you’ve never ridden before, you'll be a small group so we will be on hand to help, instruct and support you. After riding you can explore our small village and go up to the XI century watchtower to see the amazing views. Then we will cook and share a traditional paella in our garden made with homegrown and very local products, while we talk about life and passions. And, from May to October, you can also swim in our natural pool. So don't miss your swimsuit!",
